# DailyCodingProblem
My Challenge of Doing a Coding problem every single day.


1) Implement auto-completion. Given a large set of words (for instance 1,000,000 words) and then a single word prefix, find all words that it can complete to.
2) Given a binary tree, and a target number find if there is a path from the root to any leaf that sums up to the target.
3) Detect cycles in an directed graph 1->2->3->4->1 has a cycle.
4) TwoSum(return the indexes of the 2 numbers that add up to a target)
5) Convert an integer to a roman number
6) You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
7) Given a binary tree, check if the tree is balanced or not!!
