# DailyCodingProblem
My Challenge of Doing a Coding problem every single day.


1) Implement auto-completion. Given a large set of words (for instance 1,000,000 words) and then a single word prefix, find all words that it can complete to.
2) Given a binary tree, and a target number find if there is a path from the root to any leaf that sums up to the target.
3)Detect cycles in an undirected graph
4)Given an array of integers return the 2 indexes that add up to a certain target.
